# Solana Agent Kit v2

## Overview

Solana Agent Kit is an open-source toolkit designed to streamline the creation of Solana-powered applications with integrated wallet and transaction capabilities. Version 2 represents a complete evolution of our toolkit, providing developers with a more modular, plug-and-play experience with embedded wallet support.

With over 100,000 downloads, 1,400+ stars, and 800+ forks, Solana Agent Kit v1 saw tremendous adoption among developers but faced two major challenges:
- Input private key method that wasn't 100% secure
- Increasing tooling context and LLM hallucinations due to 100+ aggregate tools

Version 2 directly addresses these issues with a completely redesigned architecture that improves security, reduces hallucinations, and enhances developer experience.

## Key Features of v2

## Plugin Ecosystem

Solana Agent Kit v2 introduces a powerful plugin system that lets you install only what you need:

- **Token Plugin** (`@solana-agent-kit/plugin-token`): Transfer assets, swap tokens, bridge assets, and perform rug checks
- **NFT Plugin** (`@solana-agent-kit/plugin-nft`): Mint, list, and manage Metaplex NFT metadata
- **DeFi Plugin** (`@solana-agent-kit/plugin-defi`): Stake, lend, borrow, and trade on spot and perpetual markets
- **Misc Plugin** (`@solana-agent-kit/plugin-misc`): Request airdrops, access price feeds, get token information, and register domains
- **Blinks Plugin** (`@solana-agent-kit/plugin-blinks`): Interact with arcade games and other Solana protocol blinks

## Core Architecture

Solana Agent Kit v2 is built around a modular, plugin-based architecture:

graph TD
    A[Application] --> B[Agent Core]
    B --> C[Embedded Wallets]
    C --> CT[Turnkey]
    C --> CP[Privy]
    B --> D[Plugin System]
    D --> E[DeFi Plugin]
    D --> F[Token Plugin]
    D --> G[NFT Plugin]
    D --> H[Misc Plugin]
    D --> I[Blinks Plugin]
    B --> J[Adapters]
    J --> K[MCP]
    J --> L[N8N]
```

The architecture delivers significant improvements:

- **Reduced Hallucinations**: By limiting LLM exposure to only relevant tools
- **Enhanced Security**: Private keys never need to be directly input
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Optional transaction confirmation through Privy integration
- **Fine-grained Rules**: Advanced control through Turnkey integration
- **Better Performance**: Improved prompts and comprehensive evaluations

## Getting Started

Check out the [Quick Start Guide](docs/v2/setup/quickstart) for more detailed setup instructions and to create your first agent-powered application in minutes.

For complete working examples, see our [implementation examples](/docs/v2/examples/embedded-wallets/privy) that demonstrate the Agent Kit in action.

## Key Integrations

Solana Agent Kit v2 integrates with powerful tools to enhance your applications:

- **[Turnkey](https://turnkey.com)**: Implement fine-grained rules for your autonomous agent, enhancing security
- **[Privy](https://privy.io)**: Enable human-in-the-loop functionality where the agent waits for transaction confirmation
- **[LangChain](https://langchain.com)**: Leverage comprehensive evals to ensure optimal prompt performance
